/*
 * INSTRUCTION_PLAYBOOK has each element that a user must work through for the instructions of the experiment.
 * The elements of the playbook can be of type `instructions` or type `trial`. The `instructions` type must include a message
 * and the `trial` type must include the name of a trial to load, whether to randomize the goal and show the score afterwards,
 * and then optionally a condition for success on the trial. The processing code in exp.js Instructions.runInstructions
 * currently supports success conditions of "scoreMin" and "scoreEquals", i.e. the user must get a minimum score of X or
 * a score equal to Y in order to proceed to the next segment of instructions. However, other such conditions could easily
 * be added, e.g. "timeMin" for a minimum response time. When such success conditions are included, a `failureMessage`
 * must also be included to indicate to the user that they failed to meet the success conditions.
